SUBC lexical analyzer and recursive descent parser for a subset of a C-like programming language. Specification of the language (tokens and rules) can be found in lex.doc and SUBCgrammar.txt.

In order to test the parser using the shell script included, the folder tiny_test_progs with the 25 test programs has to be in the same folder as the shell script and p1 executable. To run tests: 'make p1 && sh tests.sh' or 'make all'.
