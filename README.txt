SUBC lexical analyzer and recursive descent parser for a subset of a C-like programming language. Specification of the language (tokens and rules) can be found in lex.doc and SUBCgrammar.txt.

In order to test the parser using the bash script included, the folder tiny_test_progs with the 25 test programs has to be in the same folder as the tests.sh, bash script, and p1 executable. Run tests: bash tests.sh
